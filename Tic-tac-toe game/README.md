# Tic-tac-toe
The ultimate tic-tac-toe is composed of nine tic-tac-toe boards arranged in a 3-by3 grid. 
Each smaller 3-by-3 grid is referred to as a local board and the larger one is referred to as global board.
The player's move will determine the location of board where the next player will play.
Following these rules, we implemented minimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithms for each player with different ways of calculating utilities.
Users could also play the game against the machine. About 40% of the time machine could win if the maximum search depth is set to 4.
