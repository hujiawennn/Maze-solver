# Maze solver

This project is a homework project from CS 440 in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The major implementation is in search.py. 

**Project description**:

In different mazes layout, the Pacman-like agent could find the shortest path from a given start state while eating one or dots. Four search strategies were implemented:
- Depth-first search
- Breadth-first search
- Greedy best-first search
- A* search
